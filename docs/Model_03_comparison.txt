1. IVS Spend — ARIMA(0,1,0) with drift
    AIC: 165.4 (within ARIMA class; simple model, low complexity).
    Forecast accuracy: RMSE ≈ 66, MAPE ≈ 1.3%, Theil’s U = nan (hold-out too short to compute reliably).
    Very strong out-of-sample accuracy on a small test set.
    But the model is simplistic (just a drift), so may underfit if richer drivers matter.
2. IVS Spend — SARIMAX (with exog arrivals)
    AIC: 694.6 (higher, even worse than no-exog SARIMAX baseline).
    Forecast accuracy: RMSE ≈ 688, MAPE ≈ 13.9%, Theil’s U = nan.
    Poor accuracy compared to ARIMA; adding arrivals as exog doesn’t help here.
3. IVS Spend — VAR (IVS + arrivals)
    AIC: ≈ best lag 5 with AIC ≈ mid-range (not directly comparable with ARIMA/SARIMAX).
    Forecast accuracy: RMSE ≈ 327, MAPE ≈ 6.7%, Theil’s U ≈ 2.82 (> 1, worse than naïve random walk).
    Captures some joint dynamics but underperforms ARIMA.

Verdict (IVS Spend): ARIMA(0,1,0) with drift is best.
    Lowest forecast errors by far (MAPE 1.3% vs 6.7% VAR and 13.9% SARIMAX).
    Even though it’s a very simple model, with the short quarterly sample it dominates more complex models.
    SARIMAX overfits and VAR cannot beat naïve in this window (Theil’s U > 1).
    With more historical quarters, VAR or SARIMAX may eventually add value, but for now ARIMA drift is the most reliable choice.
