1. Frequency mismatch between datasets
    IVS data is collected and reported quarterly, while International Travel arrivals are monthly.
    To merge them consistently for VAR modeling, I aggregated the arrivals data into quarterly sums before combining.
2. Parsing specialized date formats
    The arrivals dataset used a StatNZ-style code like 2020M01 for months.
    Custom parser to correctly interpret these strings as timestamps, enabling proper indexing and merging.
3. Path management and parameter tuning
    Many scripts needed manual adjustments to file paths, variable names, horizons, and parameters to run in my local environment and match the data structure.
    This ensured the models were not just generic templates but tailored to my project.
4. Comparing AIC for model selection
    Used the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to compare multiple candidate models (e.g., SARIMAX vs UCM, with and without exogenous regressors).
    Understood that AIC is a relative metric where lower values indicate a better trade-off between fit and complexity.
5. Handling deprecated methods and API changes
    Some reference scripts used outdated/deprecated methods (e.g., "M" vs "ME" frequency codes, fillna(method=…) vs .ffill()/.bfill()).
    Updated the code to comply with the latest pandas and statsmodels APIs, making it more robust and forward-compatible.
6. Recognizing and fixing data leakage issues
    Ensured that exogenous variables (like ADP guest nights) were lagged by 1 month so that the models did not “cheat” by using future information.
7. Applying transformations thoughtfully
    Applied log1p transforms to stabilize variance and safely handle zeros, and rolling 12-month sums to align ADP guest nights with annual spend.
    This reflects an understanding of both statistical modeling and the tourism context.
8. Building fallback logic for robustness
    In VAR models, implemented lag search with fallbacks (e.g., defaulting to p=1 if higher lags fail due to sample size).
    Also added handling for cases where covariance matrices are not positive definite, to keep the pipeline stable.
9. Extending scripts with explanatory visualizations
    Beyond just fitting models, I refined the plots to connect last observations with forecasts, mark the forecast start, and display confidence intervals — making results easier to interpret and present.
10. Exploring multiple modeling approaches
    tested different families of models — SARIMAX, UCM, and VAR — and learned their strengths:
        SARIMAX: flexible ARIMA with exog.
        UCM: interpretable trend/seasonal components.
        VAR: captures interdependence between multiple series.
    justified model choice (e.g., UCM over SARIMAX) using AIC and domain reasoning.
