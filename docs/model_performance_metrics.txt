1. In-sample fit (how well the model explains history) - AIC

2. Out-of-sample forecast accuracy (validation)
    RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
        Penalizes large errors heavily (squares them).
        Units are same as the series (Annual Spend, millions NZD).
        Lower = better.
    MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
        Average of absolute differences.
        Easier to interpret than RMSE, less sensitive to extreme errors.
    MAPE% (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
        Scale-free: error relative to actuals, shown as %.
    sMAPE% (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
        Similar to MAPE, but penalizes under- and over-forecasting more symmetrically.
        Useful if values can be small.

3. Forecast uncertainty - shaded areas in graph with confidence levels
