International Spend
SARIMA (no exog)
• AIC: 692.90 (AIC is only comparable within SARIMA specs).
• Forecast accuracy: RMSE ≈ 66.0, MAPE ≈ 1.49%, sMAPE ≈ 1.47%.

ARIMA (Intl)
• AIC: 966.76.
• Forecast accuracy: RMSE ≈ 62.4, MAPE ≈ 1.47%, sMAPE ≈ 1.47%.

UCM (Intl, no exog; local level + seasonal 12)
• AIC: −70.36 (only meaningful vs other UCMs).
• Forecast accuracy: RMSE ≈ 174.0, MAPE ≈ 3.57%, sMAPE ≈ 3.67%.

Random Forest (Intl; univariate lags + month + trend)
• AIC: n/a.
• Forecast accuracy: RMSE ≈ 245.7, MAPE ≈ 5.23%, sMAPE ≈ 5.44%.

Verdict (International): ARIMA edges out SARIMA (no exog).
• vs SARIMA (no exog): ~5–6% lower RMSE; MAPE and sMAPE are essentially tied.
• vs UCM: ~64% lower RMSE.
• vs Forest (univariate): ~75% lower RMSE.
Takeaway: Among univariate models, ARIMA is the most accurate for International spend.

• AIC: −114.92.
• Forecast accuracy: RMSE ≈ 373.4, MAPE ≈ 2.77%, sMAPE ≈ 2.78%.

Random Forest (Domestic; univariate lags + month + trend)
• AIC: n/a.
• Forecast accuracy: RMSE ≈ 383.6, MAPE ≈ 3.23%, sMAPE ≈ 3.17%.

Verdict (Domestic): ARIMA is best by a wide margin.
• vs UCM: ~47% lower RMSE, ~40% lower MAPE.
• vs Forest (univariate): ~48% lower RMSE and MAPE.
• vs SARIMA (no exog): ~81% lower RMSE.
Takeaway: ARIMA captures Domestic spend dynamics much better than the other univariate approaches.
