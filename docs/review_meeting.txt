2. Tourism Electronic Card Transactions

- obtained from https://teic.mbie.govt.nz/teiccategories/datareleases/tects
- there are 3 data sets aggrgated by region, RTO(Regional Tourism Organisation) and TA(Territorial Authority)
- all of them dates from 2018 to 2025 June (aggregated monthly)
- had to convert them from excel sheets/workbooks to csv files
- TA series data split into 2 (TA-series - 2018 - 2019 & TA-series - 2020 - 2025); combined these 2 for uniformity with others


3. Accommodation Data Programme

- single file containing monthly aggrgated data from 2020 to 2025 June
- secondary aggrgations by Area type, Area, Property and measure
- there are 19 measures and these are contant across other aggregations, so we have pivoted them to be the columns
- might be pivoting other aggregations too, except time, if required in training
