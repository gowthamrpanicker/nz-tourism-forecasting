What is AIC?
    AIC = −2 × (log-likelihood) + 2 × (number of parameters)
    It’s an information-theoretic score that balances:
        Goodness of fit (how well the model explains the data, via likelihood)
        Complexity penalty (how many parameters it uses)
So, it rewards models that fit better but penalizes models that are too complex (to avoid overfitting).

Why is AIC significant in time series (e.g., SARIMAX, VAR)?
    When you test multiple lag orders, seasonal terms, or exogenous factors, you’ll often get several “valid” models.
    AIC gives a consistent rule: the lower the AIC, the more efficient the model is at capturing structure without wasting parameters.
    In VAR, for example, AIC helps decide how many lags are needed:
        Few lags → risk underfitting.
        Many lags → risk overfitting.
        AIC picks the “sweet spot.”

How to interpret AIC values
    Relative, not absolute
        AIC has no absolute scale (−200, +50, etc. means nothing by itself).
        What matters: comparing models fit to the same dataset.
    Lower is better
        Model with the lowest AIC among candidates is usually preferred.
        A difference of 2–4 suggests mild support for the lower-AIC model.
        A difference of >10 means very strong support.
    Not a guarantee of “truth”
        AIC doesn’t say “this model is correct,” only that it’s the most efficient among the ones compared.
        It assumes the true data-generating process is not in your candidate set, but you want the closest approximation.

In our case
    When you print AIC for VAR with different lags:
        If lag=2 gives AIC=100, and lag=3 gives AIC=95 → lag=3 is better.
        If lag=3 gives AIC=95, lag=4 gives AIC=94.5 → not much gain, you may still pick lag=3 for parsimony.
    For SARIMAX/UCM comparisons (e.g., with vs without exog):
        If exog model has much lower AIC, it means the exogenous factor explains significant structure.
        If difference is small (say <2), then exog might not add much.

In summary:
    AIC helps you choose the best model among competing ones.
    Always pick the lowest AIC, but also check how big the difference is.
    It’s about balance: good fit without unnecessary complexity.
